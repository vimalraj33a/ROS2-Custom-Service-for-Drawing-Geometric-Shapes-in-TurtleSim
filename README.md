# ROS2-Custom-Service-for-Drawing-Geometric-Shapes-in-TurtleSim
This project demonstrates a complete ROS2 client–server model where a client sends a request containing a geometric shape (circle, square, rectangle, triangle), and a server node uses TurtleSim to draw the requested shape.

Features:

Custom ROS2 Service (DrawShape.srv)

Python-based ROS2 client & server

TurtleSim motion control using /turtle1/cmd_vel

Circle, Square, Rectangle, Triangle drawing

Returns shape name, dimensions & response message

Clean, modular architecture (2 ROS2 packages)
